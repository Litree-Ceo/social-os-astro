# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a modern, content-focused website built with Astro.js. It aims to be highly performant, SEO-friendly, and visually appealing. The site will showcase the capabilities of Astro's "Islands Architecture" by combining static content with interactive components.

## Implemented Features

### Initial Setup

*   Astro.js project structure.
*   Basic layout with Google Fonts (Inter and Space Grotesk).
*   File-based routing.

## Current Plan: "Get everything my site needs"

The user has requested a comprehensive update to the site. The following steps will be taken to fulfill this request:

1.  **Enhance the Layout:**
    *   Create a more robust and visually appealing layout in `src/layouts/Layout.astro`.
    *   Add a navigation bar with links to different pages.
    *   Ensure the layout is responsive.

2.  **Apply Modern Styling:**
    *   Update `src/styles/global.css` with a modern color palette, typography, and spacing.
    *   Implement a consistent design system.
    *   Add a subtle noise texture to the background for a premium feel.
    *   Use drop shadows to create depth.

3.  **Add Homepage Content:**
    *   Update `src/pages/index.astro` with compelling content.
    *   Use a hero section to grab the user's attention.
    *   Showcase features in a card-based layout.

4.  **Introduce Interactivity:**
    *   Create a simple interactive component (e.g., a theme switcher) to demonstrate Astro's partial hydration.
    *   Use a UI framework like React for the interactive "island."

5.  **Review and Refine:**
    *   Check for errors and ensure the site is fully functional.
    *   Verify that the design is responsive and accessible.
